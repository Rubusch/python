Euler's Phi Function

The number of integers in Z[m] relatively prime to m is denoted by Phi(m)

The theorem answers the question of how many numbers in a set are relatively
prime to m.

Let m have the following canonical factorization
    m = p[1]^{e1} * p[2]^{e2} * p[3]^{e3} * ... p[n]^{en}

where the p[i] are distinct prime numbers and e[i] are positive integers, then
    Phi(m) = Product[i=1; n]( p[i]^{ei} - pi^{ei-1} )


algorithm:

TODO          


example:

let m = 240; the factorization of 240 in the canonical factorization form is
    m = 240 = 16 * 15 = 2^4 * 3 * 5 = p1^{e1} * p2^{e2} * p3^{e3}

there are 3 distinct prime factors, i.e. n = 3. The value for Euler's phi
function follows then as:
    Phi(m) = (2^4 - 2^3)(3^1 - 3^0)(5^1 - 5^0) = 8 * 2 * 4 = 64

that means, 64 integers in the range {0,1,...,239} are coprime to m = 240

it is obvious that this method is straightforward in comparison to compute all
240 gcds.
