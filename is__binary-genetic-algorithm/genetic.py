# Question 1.
#
# Implement a binary Genetic Algorithm that uses fitness proportional selection,
# 1-point crossover, and bit-flip mutation to solve the problem in which the
# fitness is the number of 1s in the chromosome, i.e. the optimal solution is
# the chromosome where all genes are set to 1.
#
# A. (40 points) Run the algorithm 10 times for each of the four following
# versions of the problem:
# l = 5, 10, 20, 50, where l is the length of the chromosomes. Vary the
# population size and mutation rate to obtain good results (fast solution).
#
# B. (10 points) Plot the best fitness in each generation (averaged over the 10
# runs), for each of the four problems. There should be one graph with four
# curves, the x-axis being the generations, and the y-axis the average (best)
# fitness.


# 1. initialize random popolation of candidate solutions
# 2. evaluate solutions on problem and assign a fitnes score
# 3. select some solutions for mating
# 4. recombine: create new solutions from selected ones by exchanging structure
# 5. IF good solution not found: GOTO 2
   




print "READY."
